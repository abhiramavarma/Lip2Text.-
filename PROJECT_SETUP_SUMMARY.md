- ✅ Removed duplicate video processor files (kept only `process_video.py`)
- ✅ Organized test videos into `test_data/` folder
- ✅ Removed test transcription files
- ✅ Removed redundant documentation files
- ✅ Created proper folder structure

### 2. Git Configuration
- ✅ Updated `.gitignore` to properly exclude generated files while allowing test data
- ✅ Remote set to: `https://github.com/abhiramavarma/Lip2Text.-.git`
- ✅ Local git config set to: `abhiramavarma <abhiramavarma@gmail.com>`
- ✅ Created `.gitattributes` for consistent line endings

### 3. Documentation
- ✅ Updated `README.md` with all usage instructions
- ✅ Updated `VIDEO_PROCESSOR_README.md`
- ✅ Created `GIT_SETUP.md` with instructions for fixing author history
- ✅ Created `CONTRIBUTING.md`

### 4. Code Quality
- ✅ Fixed typos in code (e.g., "respose" → "response")
- ✅ Organized `requirements.txt` with proper categories
- ✅ Formatted code files

## 🔧 Next Steps - Fixing Git Author History

Your repository currently has commits from two authors:
- `abhiramavarma` (your commits) ✅
- `Amanvir Parhar` (old commits) ⚠️

To show **only your contributions**, you have two options:

### Option 1: Fresh Start (Recommended for New Repo)

Since this is a new repository, the cleanest approach is to start fresh:

```bash
# 1. Stage all current files
git add .

# 2. Create a single commit with your name
git commit -m "Initial commit: Lip2Text project"

# 3. Force push to overwrite history
git push -u origin main --force
```

**This will lose commit history but ensures only your name appears.**

### Option 2: Rewrite History (Preserves Commits)

If you want to keep the commit history but fix authorship:

```bash
# 1. Run the author fix script
./fix_git_authors.sh

# 2. Verify changes
git log --format='%an %ae' | sort -u

# 3. Force push
git push --force --all
```

**Note:** Force pushing rewrites remote history. Only do this if you're sure!

## 📝 Files Ready to Commit

All necessary files are organized and ready:

```bash
# Check status
git status

# Add all files
git add .

# Commit with your name (already configured)
git commit -m "Project cleanup and organization"

# Push to new repository
git push -u origin main
```

## 🎯 Important Notes

1. **Model Files**: The actual model files (`.pth`, `.json`) in `benchmarks/` are excluded from git due to size. You'll need to download them separately.

2. **Test Videos**: Videos in `test_data/` are included. Videos in root directory are ignored.

3. **Output Directories**: `uploads/` and `tts/` directories are gitignored as they contain runtime-generated files.

4. **Virtual Environment**: The `venv/` folder is gitignored. Users should create their own virtual environment.

## ✨ Result

After completing the setup, your repository will:
- ✅ Show only your contributions
- ✅ Have a clean, organized structure
- ✅ Include all necessary files
- ✅ Exclude generated/temporary files
- ✅ Have proper documentation
